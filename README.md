This application uses the IMDB API and starts off by displaying the most most recent top 20 movies from its website. The application uses collectionViews, networks calls, image caching, and a Search bar to search functionality to look up a specific movie.
The search bar functionality still needs some work, as not all collectionView cards get updated when scrolling down or when clearning the search bar.
